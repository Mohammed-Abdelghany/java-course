# ☕ Java OCA Study Guide — Practice Solutions

Welcome to my **OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I (1Z0-808)** practice folder!  
Here, I’m documenting my progress while solving **chapter-by-chapter questions** from the official study guide.

Each chapter has its own `.md` file containing:
- ✅ Important notes & explanations
- 💡 Common pitfalls
- 🧩 Multiple-choice questions with reasoning

---

## 📚 Chapters

| Chapter | Topic | File |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Java Building Blocks | [`chapter1_notes.md`](chapter1_notes.md) |
| 2 | Operators and Statements | `chapter2_notes.md` *(coming soon)* |
| 3 | Core Java APIs | `chapter3_notes.md` *(planned)* |

### 🧠 Goal
To master every exam objective through hands-on coding and detailed explanations — not just memorization.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Setup
- Java SE 17 (compatible with SE 8 features)
